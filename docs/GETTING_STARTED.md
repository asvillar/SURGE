# Getting started with SURGE

One page from zero to a trained surrogate with figures. Python 3.10–3.12.

## 1 · Install (2 minutes)

With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/S-Villar/SURGE.git && cd SURGE
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[torch,dev]"
```

With plain pip: replace the last two lines with
`python3.11 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate` and
`pip install -e ".[torch,dev]"`.

Minimal install (`uv pip install -e .`) gives you the scikit-learn model
families; `[torch]` adds the neural adapters (MLPs, FNO, U-Net, vision,
sequence models).

Check what you got — including *why* any optional model family is absent:

```bash
surge models --verbose
```

## 2 · First surrogate (30 seconds)

```bash
python -m examples.quickstart --dataset diabetes --model rf --infer
```

This downloads nothing exotic (scikit-learn's diabetes set), trains a
random forest, and writes a complete, reproducible run:

```text
runs/diabetes_rf/
├── metrics.json         # train/val/test R², RMSE, MAE per model
├── spec.yaml            # re-run with: surge run runs/diabetes_rf/spec.yaml
├── models/  scalers/  predictions/   # artifacts for inference
└── git_rev.txt  env.txt  model_card_*.json   # provenance
```

## 3 · Your own data

Point a YAML spec at any CSV / Parquet / Pickle / HDF5 / NetCDF file.
Columns named `y_*`, `output_*`, or `target_*` are auto-detected as
outputs; otherwise list them explicitly in a metadata file.

```yaml
# my_surrogate.yaml
dataset_path: path/to/data.csv
models:
  - key: sklearn.random_forest
  - key: pytorch.residual_mlp
    hpo: {n_trials: 20, metric: val_rmse}
run_tag: my_first_surrogate
```

```bash
surge run my_surrogate.yaml
```

Model shortlist by task: tabular → `sklearn.random_forest`,
`xgboost.xgbregressor`, `pytorch.residual_mlp` · 1D/2D fields →
`pytorch.fno1d` / `pytorch.fno2d`, `pytorch.unet` · sequences →
`pytorch.lstm` · uncertainty → `sklearn.gpr`, `botorch.gp`.

## 4 · Benchmarks and reports

```bash
surge list                                                  # what exists
surge bench -b synthetic.regression_1d -m sklearn.random_forest --no-save
surge bench -b tabular.california_housing -m all --seeds 5  # mean ± std
surge report --out leaderboard.html                         # dashboard
python examples/viz_theme_gallery.py                        # figure gallery
```

`surge report` builds a self-contained HTML leaderboard (spider charts,
dataset previews, sortable tables) from your local results — no server,
no network.

## 5 · Verify your installation

```bash
pytest -q tests/test_e2e_release_smoke.py    # seconds
pytest -q                                    # full suite
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause & fix |
|---|---|
| A model key is "not registered" | Its optional dependency is missing or broken. `surge models --verbose` shows the exact reason per adapter. |
| `lgbm.*` / `xgboost.*` missing on macOS | The OpenMP runtime is absent: `brew install libomp`, then reinstall/re-import. |
| First benchmark run is slow / downloads | Network-backed benchmarks (OpenML, MNIST/CIFAR, ConStellaration) cache under `data/datasets/benchmarks/` on first use; later runs are offline. |
| `pytorch.*` models absent | Install the extra: `uv pip install -e ".[torch]"`. |
| GPflow models (any platform) | `uv pip install -e ".[gpflow]"` then `uv pip install gpflow --no-deps`. gpflow's published metadata pins `numpy<2` (and the dead `tensorflow-macos` on Apple Silicon), which no modern resolver can satisfy next to TF ≥ 2.21 — but gpflow 2.11 runs fine on NumPy 2.x. The `[gpflow]` extra provides the full TF stack **and** gpflow's pure-Python deps (check_shapes, tabulate, …), so `--no-deps` is safe. Verified: TF 2.21 + GPflow 2.11.1 + NumPy 2.5. |
| Keras/TensorFlow models absent | Install `.[tensorflow]` (or `.[gpflow]`); `keras.mlp` then appears in `surge models`. |
| Grouped samples (shots, trajectories) | Splits are random-only today — leakage risk. Track the split-strategy roadmap in `docs/design/ARCHITECTURE_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` (R4). |


## Editor autocomplete for spec files

SURGE ships a JSON Schema for workflow specs
(`surge/workflow/spec.schema.json`). With the YAML language server
(VS Code "YAML" extension), add this line at the top of any spec to get
completion, hover docs, and inline validation while you type:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S-Villar/SURGE/main/surge/workflow/spec.schema.json
```

Offline check of any spec (unknown keys, typos with suggestions, bad
types, unknown model keys):

```bash
surge validate my_spec.yaml
```
